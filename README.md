This extension was developed to help users navigate Chrome more easily with
a keyboard.

## Features

This extension overwrites the default behavior of the space and escape keys
on Chrome to make keyboard navigation easier.

### Space Key

This extension makes the space key scroll half a page, instead of a full page.
Similarly, pressing shift+space scrolls back half a page.

When the browser has focus on a clickable element, the default behavior of the
browser is to click on this element with space or enter keys. This extension
overwrites this behaviour. The space key is used for scrolling only, except for
when the user is typing text (then the default behavior is kept). The user
can still interact with clickable elements with the enter key.

### Escape Key

The escape key can now be used to remove focus from the active element. This
allows keyboard users to conveniently focus back to the body of the document,
rather than having to click away from the active element.

## Future Work

I plan on making the extension more customizable in the future, by adding the
following features:

- Customizable scroll distance (options for scrolling a pre-specified or custom
amount with the space key)
